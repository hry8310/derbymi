/**
 * <p>
 * This visitor replaces a {@code ValueNode} with a node representing a constant
 * value, if the {@code ValueNode} is known to always evaluate to the same
 * value. It may for instance replace a sub-tree representing {@code 1=1} with a
 * constant {@code TRUE}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The actual evaluation of the {@code ValueNode}s is performed by invoking
 * {@link ValueNode#evaluateConstantExpressions()} on every {@code ValueNode} in
 * the query tree.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In contrast to most other visitors, this visitor walks the tree bottom-up.
 * Top-down processing of the tree would only evaluate constant expressions at
 * the leaf level, so for instance {@code (1=1)=(1=2)} would only be simplified
 * to {@code TRUE=FALSE}. With bottom-up processing, the top-level = node will
 * be processed after the leaves, and it sees the intermediate tree
 * {@code TRUE=FALSE} which it is able to transform into the even simpler tree
 * {@code FALSE}.
